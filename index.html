<!--Hello, maker! Welcome to my Electrate Fuego web design tutorial. I'm glad you found it – for this might be a real intersection on your way to becoming. Just follow along with comments like this one, and you'll make a really cool web documemt that not only introduces you to the other people in our classes, but will help you process how different discourse communities in your life have contributed to your arrival in this space, virtual and actual, and also contribute to where you might be going.

In this doc, you will work through Gregory Ulmer's discourses of career, family, entertainment, community, and schooling (_Internet Invention From Literacy to Electracy_, 2002.) In Ulmer's text, he elides community and schooling into one category, but for our puposes I have separated them. Ulmer's theory of electracy helps makes sense of how we find/construct meaning and connect with others rhetorically in a media rich ecology. Ulmer uses analogy to define electracy, explaining that "electracy is to digital media what literacy is to print."

You could make this document the easy way by posting on Google Site, an Adobe Spark, a Weebly, or a Wix, or you can do a little more work to unconceal, opening up these tools that you use every day, but might not know how they function, yet prove so necessary to how you (re)present yourself and connect with others in virtual spaces. And this last bit is an important point! If we really want to be makers, if we really want to be creative, then we need to understand what our digital tools do, how they work, and consider the implications of their use. Through this process you will also learn a little bit about computer literacy and computer science...enough to allow you to build web texts and understand file management.

So let's cut this thing open – using "tmesis" as the Ancient Greeks would call it – lets "cut" and arrange, tweak, take away and augment...that's how we create! I hope you're excited to use this tool to create a document that will simultaneously help you process your journey and help orient you along the path on which you are headed in your becoming. Before we get going I would like to give a shout-out to my research buddy Shauna Chung, who helped me develop the original Ulmerian framework we will be following in this document. Are you ready to get started?-->

 <!--To get started, you will need to fork my repository from GitHub if you haven't already. If you want to easily publish it on GitHub, I'll give you more information at the end of this document. But for right now, fork, and then download the website to a zip file (or clone it, if you know what that means). Go ahead and put these files in a secure place (folder) where you will be able to find them and organize your other assests like images, pdfs, etcetera. You will also need a text editor like "brackets.io" or "atom.io" or "notepad-plus-plus.org." Open the index.html and style.css files in the text editor and we can get started building our own electrate experience.-->

<!--BTW. You can leave these hidden HTML text fields be, or delete them. They are but road signs, absent from the larger design-->

<!--First we will need to do some work in the head of the document. The head organizes important information needed to expalin to browsers how the website will work. Go ahead and change the title of this HTML document below, from "Electrate Fuego" to whatever you want it to be called. Your new text will appear in your browser tab-->
<title>I am Julia Trunzo</title>
<!--this next section of code does important work to help different browsers understand what this page should look like on the different kinds of screens.-->
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
<!--Next is a link to the cascading style sheet or CSS file. Web designers use a cascading stylesheet CSS to add styling to a website. Designers do this by "calling" a <div class> in HTML and defining the class attributes on the style sheet. Doing so saves time and results in less code. On the style.css page you'll find attributes relating to font, text size, image size, among other details.-->
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
</head>

<!--The <body> of the document houses the content that a user usually sees on a website. We'll be spending most of our time in this section.-->
<body>

<!-- We'll need to do some more work in this section, but to do so, we'll need to make some changes on your style.css file. Developers refer to this division as a "Hero Block," but we will refer to it as a "Wide Image."  Think carefully about the image you select and how it might serve a sybolic function in your life. Ulmer refers to these kinds of symbolic images as "wide images" in that they often repeat over and over in our lifetime. We will similarly repeat this image at the end of your Electrate Infuego composition to establish a motif in this web document.-->

<!--The hero image is controlled on the style.css page. To replace this image, simply place a .jpg file in the same file folder (directory) as this project and name it hero.jpg. Alternatively, if you are working with a .png, you will need to open the style.css file using your text editor, and change the file type from .jpg to .png. Browsers will only work with .jpg, .jpeg, or .png imgaes. Since hero images need to stretch across the screen, typically you will want to select an image 1200px in width to allow quick load time yet avoid pixilation.-->

<div class="hero-image">
  <div class="hero-text">
<!--Next, change the other relevant information in this section, especially if you're not "John en Fuego" or not majoring in "electracy"-->
      <h1>Hi! I'm Julia Trunzo</h1>
      <h2>I am studying Communication Rhetoric and Public & Professional Writing with a minor in Italian.</h2>

<!--In our first exploration of discourse, we're going to think about the wider characteristics or themes of our field or future career. In academia, we do a lot of work narrowing our interest to arrive at a career or profession, often reducing our field to a level of operation or an act. Instead, I would like you to think more broadly about the "wider themes" you associate with your field or future career and its larger significance in improving our world. Yes...improving the world. Thinking back, where do you see exposure to those same "wider themes" in your own life? Those ah-ha moments, lessons, examples, tools, passions, or qualities that suggested this career path to you? Replace the content between <h2> and </h2> that begins with "Lorem ipsum."-->

<div class="textblock">
  <h2>About Me</h2>

  <p>I am a junior in the Deitrich School of Arts and Sciences at the University of Pittsburgh. My hope is to attend Pitt's Master of Arts in Teaching English program after my undergraduate work. I want to make a difference in the lives of kids and be like the teachers who made an impact on MY life. I love doing art in my free time and even run my own art Instagram and do commissions for people! <a href=https://www.instagram.com/jtrunzcustoms/?hl=en>See here</a>.</p>
</div>

<!--Replace the image here. You can also control image width and height %. This is the second way we can control the size of images on our website.-->

<div>
<img src="panther.jpg" alt="me next to panther" class="center-img"  style="max-width:50%; max-height:50%;">
  </div>

<!--in this next section you will explain a little more about your family (what does family means to you? Who are the people that influenced you on this path along which you now stand).-->

<div class="textblock">
  <h2>What "Home" Means to Me</h2>
    </div>

<!--Show us. Find those beautiful, meaningful "family" photos and pictures of your place (only you can define family). If you are concerned about issues of privacy, you can always use stock images, or get creative. Add these photos to your project folder, making sure the files end in .jpg or .png and replace the names in the grid code below. You can add more images if you wish, or subtract...you might also need to move content around to achieve balance. See what happens – sometimes you have to be playful to find the purpose of things. Since these images are smaller, you will want to resize your images to less than 600px in width. This will improve load time and thus general accesibility. Don't forget to add alt="text"-->

<!--A photo grid uses rows and column classes to create some divisions on the page that will scale with mobile devices. The style.css page provides other attributes that will adjust the image depending on the size of screens.-->


<div class="row">
  <div class="column">
    <img src="brothers waving.jpeg" alt="me and my brothers on the beach">
    <img src="mom+dad.jpg" alt="Mom and dad on beach">

  <div class="column">

    <img src="me and nick.jpeg" alt="me holding nick's arm">
    <img src="me and luke.jpeg" alt="me and lukie">
  </div>
</div>

<!--Time to write. Flesh it out! Define family, qualify it, explicate it telling us why these people are important, and how they contributed to how you got here and where you are going. What about "home." What  does that mean to you? In what ways is it significant in determining where your are going? Replace the content between <h2> and </h2> that says "Lorem ipsum."-->

<div class="textblock">
  <p>My family means the world to me, and I was raised very close with my parents and three brothers. I am the second oldest, at age 20. My older brother Andrew is 24 and my younger brothers Nicholas and Luke are 18 and 16 years old. I treasure the time that I spend with my brothers, and even though two of us are no longer living in our childhood home because we are older, we make a huge effort to find a way to spend time there all together. While the pandemic has been hard for everyone in the world, one blessing that came out of it is that my family was able to spend a lot of time as a whole with all 6 of us. School was online and so was work, so we all spent our days on our computers and our nights laughing around the kitchen table. This is time that none of us ever thought we would get to have in our home all together again and that none of us will ever forget. My home is wherever they are. Whether that is in the suburbs of Pittsburgh or at a rental house in Topsail Island, North Carolina in the summers (our favorite place to vacation to), it does not matter where we are so long as we are together. </p>
</div>


<!--Now we are moving into the kinds of media that contributes to your everyday discourse. This might sound weird, but Ulmer argues that media has actually contributed a great deal to who you are as a person, how you language yourself, and even how you move through the world and interact with others. So, let's take some time to explore this discourse area. You have the opportunity to add video content or other significant media content. You might also add images to this section (see the bottom

of this sheet for directions on how to add elements) perhaps adding a photo grid like the one you did for the "Family" section. Experiment. You can't break this thing, right? Control Z. Control Z. Control Z... -->

      <h2>Imaginary App</h2>
      <p>Don't Break the Bank is a digital piggy bank that you set your money into before going out. It links to your bank account information and allows you to budget a certain amount and then prevents you from making poor financial choices after that set amount is used up.</p>
      </div>
      <p>PDF of my Imaginary App <a href="Don't Break The Bank.pdf">example</a>.</p>
       </body>
        <p>I came up with this IA idea when we were brainstorming in class about different ideas for apps that intersect the typical thought process behind doing typical tasks. When you go out with friends, it is a subconscious act to take your card out and pay without thinking about the amount left in your bank account. During my discussion with classmates we also talked about how we have heard many stories of people going out with friends and waking up the next morning with a much greater amount gone from their bank account than they expected. This is what jumpstarted this idea in my brain for a virtual piggy bank which locks in a maximum amount you set for yourself to spend before going out. I created my image in InDesign to depict someone holding their phone with the app open to the virtual piggy bank image and the depiction of money spent versus money left. I believe that this app would impact the way that people budget for personal or social areas, especially surrounding going out for food and drinks with friends or going on trips or vacations. This is the goal I had in mind so that there would be an in between in people's thought processes before completing a transaction through the app. I got stuck in thinking about how this would come into fruition/regulations with banks, but since this is all hypothetical I think it is a good start to a plan.

FUN FACT: "Lorem ipsum", "Lorem ipsum" was hacked out of Cicero's "De finibus bonorum et malorum," developers made it non-sensical. So while you will probably never write as well as Cicero, you can always improve upon "Lorem ipsum." -->
